<article>Mountain bikes are rugged off-road bicycles built to tackle challenging terrain and adventurous trails. Featuring sturdy frames, wide tires with deep treads, and suspension systems, they provide stability and shock absorption on rough surfaces. Mountain bikes come in various styles, including hardtail (with front suspension only) and full-suspension (with both front and rear suspension), catering to different riding preferences and trail conditions. They often incorporate disc brakes for reliable stopping power in all weather conditions. Mountain biking enthusiasts enjoy the thrill of exploring nature, conquering obstacles, and descending steep descents. With their versatility and durability, mountain bikes offer endless opportunities for outdoor adventure and exploration.</article>
